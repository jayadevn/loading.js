Loading.js
==========
Loading.js is a jQuery Plugin for Loading with a progress bar easy to use.

In all our projects we have at least one progress bar, as there is not any complete JavaScript loading plugin with progress bar, I've created one. 

My main chalenge is to keep it simple:

For example:
```
$('#simple-loading').loading();
```
This is what you need to add your jquery plugin into work
